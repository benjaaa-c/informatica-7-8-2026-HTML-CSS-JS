<p>“In coming days,” President Nelson said, “it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.”</p>
“I feel to emphasize [this] warning,” President Oaks said. “You live in a season where the adversary has
become so effective at disguising truth that if you don’t have the Holy Ghost, you will be deceived.</p>
<p>Many obstacles lie ahead. The distractions will be many. Even active members may sometimes have</p>
<p>concerns about some historical, doctrinal, or social issues connected with the Church.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>To help all Latter-day Saints “overcome present or future doubts,” President Oaks, the prophet and</p>
<p>former BYU president (1971–1980), pointed to four simple actions that can help them come closer to the Savior.</p>
